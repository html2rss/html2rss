      <h2>ACME Corp's Article Without Status (Status: Unknown)</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>This article doesn't have a status field, so it should use a fallback or empty value in the template. It's
          like a function that returns void but actually returns null.</p>
        <p>This tests how the template handles missing values. In programming terms, this is the equivalent of a null
          pointer exception waiting to happen.</p>
