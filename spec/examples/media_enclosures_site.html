      <h3>Episode 42: The Future of AI in Web Development (The Answer to Everything)</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p>In this episode, we explore how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing web development. We discuss the
          latest tools, frameworks, and methodologies that are changing the way developers build applications. Spoiler:
          It's still going to be broken in production.</p>
        <p>Our guest speaker, Dr. Sarah Johnson from ACME Corp, shares insights from her research on AI-assisted coding
          and the
          potential impact on the industry. She reveals that AI can now write better commit messages than most
          developers.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction to AI in web development (and why it still needs coffee)</li>
          <li>Current tools and frameworks (that will be obsolete next week)</li>
          <li>Future predictions and trends (spoiler: more bugs)</li>

      <h3>Episode 41: Building Scalable React Applications (Without Losing Your Mind)</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p>This episode covers best practices for building scalable React applications. We dive deep into performance
          optimization, state management, and architectural patterns. Warning: May cause existential crisis about your
          code quality.</p>
        <p>Topics include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Component optimization techniques (and why your components are too big)</li>
          <li>State management strategies (Redux vs Context vs "just put it in a global variable")</li>
          <li>Code splitting and lazy loading (because nobody wants to load your entire app at once)</li>
          <li>Testing strategies for large applications (spoiler: you should actually write tests)</li>
