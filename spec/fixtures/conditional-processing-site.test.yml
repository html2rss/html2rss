## Conditional Processing

Use post-processors for conditional logic:

selectors:
  items:
    selector: ".item"
  title:
    selector: "h2"
  status:
    selector: ".status"
  description:
    selector: ".content"
    post_process:
      - name: "template"
        string: "[Status: %<status>s] %<self>s"  # Fixed: use 'string' instead of 'template' and correct syntax
  published_at:
    selector: ".date"
    post_process:
      - name: "parse_time"
  categories:
    - status  # Include status as a category
